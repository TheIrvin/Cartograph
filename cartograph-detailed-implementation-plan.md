## 0. How to Use This Doc

### 0.1 Status legend

| Icon | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| ⬜ | Not Started | No work begun |
| 🟡 | In Progress | Actively being built |
| 🔵 | In Review | PR open / awaiting review |
| ✅ | Done | Meets Definition of Done (§6.9) |
| 🚫 | Blocked | Waiting on a dependency or decision (note the blocker in the card) |
| ❌ | Cut | Intentionally dropped (note the reason) |

### 0.2 Priority & effort

| Priority | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **P0** | Launch blocker — the phase's exit gate fails without it |
| **P1** | Should-have — noticeably weakens the phase if missing, but shippable without |
| **P2** | Nice-to-have — quality-of-life or forward-looking |
| **P3** | Later — revisit at the next phase gate |

| Effort | Size |
|---|---|
| XS | < 0.5 day |
| S | < 1 day |
| M | 1–3 days |
| L | 3–7 days |
| XL | > 1 week |

### 0.3 Feature ID convention

`F{phase}.{nn}` — e.g. `F0.23` is the 23rd feature of Phase 0. IDs are permanent: never renumber, only add. Dependencies always reference IDs, so re-planning never breaks the graph.

### 0.4 Update workflow (the tracking contract)

1. When you start a feature: flip status to 🟡 in the master tracker (§1) and on the card.
2. When a PR opens: 🔵. When merged **and** acceptance criteria are verified: ✅.
3. Any deviation from scope (new sub-task, cut criterion) gets a line in the card's **Notes**.
4. Every status change appends one line to the changelog (§9): `YYYY-MM-DD · F0.23 ⬜→✅ · note`.
5. **Minimal-first:** a feature touched in an earlier wave in minimal form stays 🟡 (In Progress) until *every* acceptance criterion on its card passes. The CSV `wave` column records the wave where the **full** criteria are met — Wave-1 vertical slices therefore leave features 🟡, never ✅.

## 2. Phase 0 — MVP (Weeks 1–4): the viral surface

**Phase goal (from Strategy §6):** something a stranger can try in 20 seconds and want to screenshot.

### Epic 0.1 — Foundation & Infrastructure

Everything else sits on this. Kept deliberately small — no infra beyond what a first-time visitor can see.

#### F0.01 — Monorepo scaffold & tooling `P0 · S`
**Status:** 🟡 — Java 17/Maven backend scaffold merged; planned multi-app tooling and frontend remain unbuilt. Spring Boot override applies to this slice.
**Story:** As a developer on this project, I want a ready monorepo so every feature lands in the right place from day one.
**Sub-tasks:** pnpm workspaces with `apps/web` (Next.js + TS + Tailwind), `apps/api` (Node.js + TypeScript — route handlers + indexing worker; Strategy §7 amendment), `packages/parser`, `packages/graph`, `packages/context-assembler`, `packages/shared-types`; lint/format config; conventional-commit hook; `.editorconfig`; README skeleton.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `pnpm dev` boots web + api concurrently with one command.
- [ ] All packages import `shared-types` without copy-pasted type definitions.
- [ ] Repo structure matches Strategy §8 exactly.
**Depends on:** — · **Notes:** Directory names are load-bearing — later features reference them.

#### F0.02 — Shared types & API contracts `P0 · S`
**Status:** 🟡 — Java domain records, ports, and validated REST DTOs exist; cross-client contracts and CI drift checks remain.
**Story:** As a full-stack dev, I want one source of truth for API types so the API can't drift from the client.
**Sub-tasks:** hand-authored TS types in `packages/shared-types` — single language after the 2026-10-01 stack consolidation, so no cross-language codegen layer; `Symbol`, `Edge`, `GraphSnapshot`, `IndexJob`, `ApiError` types; versioned API envelope (`{ data, meta }`); runtime validation at the API boundary (zod or equivalent).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Web and api import every shared type from `shared-types` (no duplicated definitions).
- [ ] A deliberately breaking type change fails typecheck in CI.
**Depends on:** F0.01.

#### F0.03 — CI pipeline `P0 · S`
**Sub-tasks:** GitHub Actions: lint + typecheck + unit tests per package; run on PRs and main; caching for pnpm and pip.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] PR with failing test/lint cannot merge (branch protection on).
- [ ] CI completes < 5 min.
**Depends on:** F0.01.

#### F0.04 — Deploy pipeline & environments `P0 · S`
**Sub-tasks:** Vercel for `apps/web` (prod + preview per PR); Fly.io for `apps/api` + parsing workers; staging env; deploy-on-merge to main.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Merge to main deploys both apps with zero manual steps.
- [ ] Every PR gets a preview URL.
- [ ] Rollback documented and tested once.
**Depends on:** F0.01.

#### F0.05 — Secrets & config management `P0 · S`
**Status:** 🟡 — Environment-backed GitHub token and example configuration exist; deployment secret management/scanning not verified.
**Sub-tasks:** `.env.example` as the canonical config surface; secrets in Vercel/Fly dashboards only; config validation at boot (fail fast on missing var).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Fresh clone + `.env.example` → app boots locally with no tribal knowledge.
- [ ] No secret value ever committed (secret-scanning enabled).
**Depends on:** F0.01.

#### F0.06 — Error tracking & product analytics `P1 · S`
**Sub-tasks:** Sentry (web + api); PostHog with a documented event-naming convention (`object_verb`, lowercase); no PII in payloads.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] An exception in staging shows in Sentry with stack + release tag.
- [ ] Event taxonomy doc exists; first events (`repo_indexed`, `diagram_viewed`) fire.
**Depends on:** F0.04. **Notes:** Full event list in §6.7.

### Epic 0.2 — Repo Ingestion

#### F0.07 — URL input & validation `P0 · S`
**Status:** 🟡 — Backend normalization and rejection tests pass; homepage input and full feature fixtures remain.
**Story:** As a visitor, I paste a GitHub URL and Cartograph accepts `github.com/owner/repo`, `/tree/branch`, `?tab=readme`-polluted URLs, and rejects everything else politely.
**Sub-tasks:** URL parser → `{owner, repo, branch?, ref?}`; normalize GitHub UI variants; homepage input + `/owner/repo` route handling; inline validation errors.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] 20 real-world GitHub URL formats in a fixture table parse correctly.
- [ ] Non-GitHub or malformed input shows a helpful inline error (never a 500).
**Depends on:** F0.02.

#### F0.08 — GitHub API client `P0 · M`
**Status:** 🟡 — Bounded retry/backoff, primary/secondary limit handling, timeouts, validated responses, bounded ETag reuse, and single-resolution SHA-pinned fetching implemented with offline regression tests. Prior unauthenticated live smoke check passed. Live authenticated acceptance is blocked on server-side `GITHUB_TOKEN`; large-repo clone routing remains dependent on F0.09. No completion claimed.
**Story:** As the ingestion pipeline, I need a resilient GitHub REST client: repo metadata, recursive git tree, file contents, latest commit SHA.
**Sub-tasks:** typed client with ETag conditional requests; rate-limit accounting (primary + secondary limits) with exponential backoff; optional `GITHUB_TOKEN` (server-side only) to raise limits; per-repo fetch plan (tree API for small repos, clone for big ones).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Handles 403 rate-limit responses gracefully with Retry-After, never crashes a job.
- [ ] Integration test against a public repo hits the happy path with and without a token.
**Depends on:** F0.02.

#### F0.09 — Shallow-clone fallback `P0 · M`
**Sub-tasks:** `git clone --depth 1` path for repos above the tree-API threshold (set in config); blob materialization from the clone; deterministic workspace temp-dir lifecycle + cleanup; clone timeout.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] A repo > 10k files indexes via clone path in CI (pinned test repo).
- [ ] No temp workspace leaks after success, failure, or timeout (cleanup verified in test).
**Depends on:** F0.08.

#### F0.10 — Repo guardrails & size caps `P0 · S`
**Status:** 🟡 — File/count/byte guards and HTTP 413 tested; full card acceptance has not been verified.
**Story:** As an operator, I need hard free-tier caps so a monorepo can't blow up compute (Strategy §11, risk #1).
**Sub-tasks:** limits in config: max files (start: 5,000), max repo blob size (start: 50 MB), max single-file size; binary/vendored dir skip-list (`node_modules`, `dist`, `.min.js`, lockfiles); pre-flight check before any heavy work.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Oversized repos are rejected in < 5s with the friendly "too big" state (F0.14), before cloning/parsing starts.
- [ ] Caps configurable per env without redeploy.
**Depends on:** F0.08.

#### F0.11 — Language detection `P0 · S`
**Status:** 🟡 — JS/TS extension selection and unsupported-file warnings exist; broader detection remains.
**Sub-tasks:** extension → language map; manifest sniffing (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `Pipfile`); emits ordered `language_set` per repo (drives which extractors run and forms part of cache keys, F0.48).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Mixed TS+Python repo detected as both; extractor list matches.
- [ ] Repos in neither supported language get the "unsupported yet" state.
**Depends on:** F0.08.

#### F0.12 — Async indexing jobs & queue `P0 · L`
**Story:** As a user with a large repo, I get a job that progresses in the background instead of a browser spinner that dies at 30s.
**Sub-tasks:** `IndexJob` state machine (`queued → fetching → parsing → building → done | failed`) with per-stage timestamps; worker pool (start: simple in-process workers on Fly.io, no Kafka — Strategy §7 note); retry policy (2 retries, backoff, poison-job quarantine); job status API; stale-job reaper.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Kill the worker mid-job → job recovers or fails cleanly, never hangs forever.
- [ ] 20 concurrent index requests don't starve the API process (load test documented).
- [ ] Job status endpoint reflects every stage transition within 2s.
**Depends on:** F0.08. **Notes:** Deliberately simple v1; swap for a real queue only when concurrency demands (Strategy §7 hosting row).

#### F0.13 — Indexing progress UI `P0 · M`
**Story:** As a user, I see live progress (stage indicator + queue position) and the page auto-transitions to the diagram when done.
**Sub-tasks:** polling or SSE from job status API; animated stage stepper; elapsed time; auto-redirect on done; "email me" is explicitly out of scope for v1.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Progress reflects real job stages (not fake timers).
- [ ] Done → diagram renders without a manual reload.
**Depends on:** F0.12.

#### F0.14 — Friendly error states `P0 · S`
**Status:** 🟡 — Structured HTTP errors implemented; designed UI states and retry affordances remain.
**Story:** Every failure mode has a designed page: repo not found · private · too large · rate-limited · unsupported language · internal error — each with a next-step suggestion.
**Sub-tasks:** error taxonomy enum shared across API/UI (via F0.02); designed states with illustration-level polish; retry affordances where sensible.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Each taxonomy member has a reachable designed state (e2e test per state).
- [ ] No raw stack trace or generic 500 is ever user-visible.
**Depends on:** F0.10, F0.12.

### Epic 0.3 — AST Parsing & Graph Building

The moat (Strategy §2, §3). Every feature here serves "accurate, not hallucinated."

#### F0.15 — tree-sitter runtime integration `P0 · M`
**Status:** 🟡 — Native JS/TS grammars tested on Java 17; Python, throughput benchmark, and timeout acceptance remain.
**Sub-tasks:** grammar loading for TS/JS + Python; native vs WASM decision documented; parse-error tolerance (never fail the whole repo on one broken file — collect per-file parse-error stats); per-file parse timeout; benchmark baseline (files/sec).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] File with syntax errors still yields partial symbols; repo-level indexing completes.
- [ ] Throughput measured and recorded (target: ≥ 2k files/min/core for TS+Python mix).
**Depends on:** F0.01.

#### F0.16 — TypeScript/JavaScript extractor `P0 · L`
**Status:** 🟡 — AST definitions, imports/exports, and direct calls tested; arrows and broader constructs remain unsupported or unresolved.
**Sub-tasks:** extract function declarations, arrow fns, class declarations, methods, object-literal methods; imports/exports/re-exports (`export * from`, barrel files, `export default`); call expressions incl. `await`, chained calls (`a.b().c()`), `new` expressions; dynamic `import()` (flagged low-confidence); tagged-template + JSX component references (P1 sub-task).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Fixture file with ≥ 30 constructs produces a hand-verified symbol/edge list (100% match).
- [ ] Chained and method calls attribute to the receiver's method when resolvable, else flagged unresolved.
**Depends on:** F0.15.

#### F0.17 — Python extractor `P0 · L`
**Sub-tasks:** `def`/`async def`, classes, methods; imports (absolute, relative, `from x import y as z`); calls incl. attribute calls; decorators (routed to F0.21 for web frameworks); `__init__.py` re-export handling.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Fixture file ≥ 30 constructs, hand-verified 100% match.
- [ ] Relative imports inside a package resolve to the right module symbols.
**Depends on:** F0.15.

#### F0.18 — Symbol & module resolution `P0 · L`
**Status:** 🟡 — Same-file lexical scope resolution exists; cross-file aliases/barrels and repo-wide resolution remain.
**Story:** Turn per-file AST facts into a repo-wide symbol table: which import refers to which real definition.
**Sub-tasks:** module-path resolution (TS path aliases via `tsconfig.json` `paths`, JS `main`/`exports` fields; Python package layout with `__init__.py`); alias/import-rename tracking; export-following through barrels; same-name disambiguation (prefer same-package, then same-repo; else unresolved); unresolved calls counted, not faked.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Barrel re-export chain (3 hops) resolves to the defining file.
- [ ] `import { db } from './db'` in two packages resolves to two distinct symbols.
- [ ] Unresolved-ratio metric emitted per repo (feeds §6.3 honesty stats).
**Depends on:** F0.16, F0.17. **Notes:** This is the hardest feature in Phase 0 — schedule it early, protect it.

#### F0.19 — Edge extraction `P0 · M`
**Status:** 🟡 — Basic calls/imports with locations round-trip through SQLite; full edge-kind and multi-callsite acceptance remain.
**Sub-tasks:** typed edges per Strategy §5: `calls`, `imports`, `extends`, `implements`, `instantiates`, `handles_route`; dedup at (from, to, kind); edge provenance (file + line of the call site) stored in `meta` for deep-linking.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every edge kind produced by at least one fixture; round-trips through the store.
- [ ] Duplicate (from,to,kind) tuples collapse to one edge with multiple call sites in `meta`.
**Depends on:** F0.18.

#### F0.20 — Confidence scoring `P0 · M`
**Status:** 🟡 — Proven edges carry confidence; full scoring rules, unresolved-ratio statistics, and UI remain.
**Story:** The honesty feature — every edge carries a confidence, and the UI renders solid vs dashed accordingly (Strategy §5).
**Sub-tasks:** scoring rules (full table in §6.3): direct static = 1.00; cross-file resolved import = 0.95; barrel re-export = 0.85; dynamic `import()`/`importlib` with literal = 0.60; duck-typed/`getattr`/`any`-typed = 0.40; threshold constant `DASHED_BELOW = 0.50` defined in exactly one place; per-repo unresolved-ratio stat.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Each rule has a unit test; threshold constant imported (not redefined) by UI + parser.
- [ ] Repo stats panel can display "% of call sites resolved statically".
**Depends on:** F0.19.

#### F0.21 — Web-framework route extraction `P1 · L`
**Story:** Entry points matter: `Route → Handler` edges for Express, Fastify, NestJS (JS/TS); Flask, FastAPI, Django (Python).
**Sub-tasks:** decorator/route-registration detection per framework (literal route strings; dynamic/parameterized routes flagged heuristic); `Route` symbol kind with `method + path` metadata; `handles_route` edges; unsupported framework → graceful skip (no crash, no fake routes).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] One fixture repo per framework yields the correct route table (verified by hand).
- [ ] Routes with computed paths (variables) render as inferred/heuristic, never as proven literals.
**Depends on:** F0.18. **Notes:** Feeds Trace Mode entry points (F1.01); P1 because the graph ships without it, but Trace Mode is weak without it.

#### F0.22 — Graph normalization & stable IDs `P0 · M`
**Status:** 🟡 — Deterministic SHA-256 IDs include snapshot and source location under the Spring spec; full multi-language and golden acceptance remain.
**Sub-tasks:** stable deterministic symbol IDs: `sha1(owner/repo/sha/relative_path/qualified_name)` (stable across re-indexes of the same commit); orphan policy (keep, flagged); self-loop policy (keep, render differently); multi-language graph merge; graph-level stats (node/edge counts by kind, unresolved ratio).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Re-indexing the same SHA produces a byte-identical graph JSON (golden test).
- [ ] Symbol IDs survive file reorderings (same commit, different fetch order).
**Depends on:** F0.19.

#### F0.23 — SQLite graph store `P0 · M`
**Status:** 🟡 — Transactional snapshot storage and reads tested in one SQLite database; planned per-snapshot files/blob storage and 2k-file benchmark remain.
**Sub-tasks:** schema per §6.1 (column-level spec below); per-(repo, sha) snapshot DB file; writer/reader API in `packages/graph`; snapshots pushed to blob storage; reader loads snapshot by key.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Snapshot for a 2k-file repo loads into the reader in < 500ms.
- [ ] Store is disposable: delete + re-index reproduces an equivalent graph (ID-stable from F0.22).
**Depends on:** F0.22.

#### F0.24 — Golden-file parser test suite `P0 · M`
**Status:** 🟡 — Small checked-in TS fixture and offline tests exist; real OSS golden corpus, precision/recall thresholds, and CI gate remain.
**Story:** The accuracy gate. Curated sample repos with hand-verified expected graphs; CI fails if accuracy regresses — this is how "accurate, not hallucinated" stays true.
**Sub-tasks:** 6–10 small real OSS repos (2–4 per language, incl. one with a web framework); expected-graph JSONs reviewed by hand; CI computes precision/recall vs thresholds (start: precision ≥ 0.95, recall ≥ 0.90 on calls; tune after first real-world run); accuracy dashboard numbers emitted per release.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] CI blocks merge on accuracy regression below thresholds.
- [ ] Adding a new golden repo is a documented 30-minute procedure.
**Depends on:** F0.23. **Notes:** See testing strategy §6.4.

### Epic 0.4 — Diagram Viewer

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] 1k-node graph lays out in < 3s (budget table §6.5).
- [ ] Toggle LR/TB re-layouts without losing selection.
**Depends on:** F0.25.

#### F0.27 — Node design system `P0 · M`
**Sub-tasks:** node types: file, function, class/method, route, cluster/group; kind icons + language color chips; long-name truncation with tooltip; selected/hover/dimmed visual states; route nodes visually distinct (they become trace entry points).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] All five kinds render distinctly; states visible in a Storybook-style gallery page.
**Depends on:** F0.25.

#### F0.28 — Edge rendering (solid vs dashed) `P0 · M`
**Story:** The differentiator made visible: statically proven edges solid, inferred edges dashed — legend explains it (Strategy §5).
**Sub-tasks:** confidence → style mapping via the single `DASHED_BELOW` constant from F0.20; edge-kind styling (calls vs imports vs extends); arrowheads; self-loops rendered as curved loops; animated-flow variant reserved for Trace Mode (F1.04).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] A fixture graph with mixed confidences renders solid/dashed exactly per the constant.
- [ ] Edge hover shows kind + confidence + call-site file:line.
**Depends on:** F0.25.

#### F0.29 — Legend & filters `P0 · S`
**Sub-tasks:** always-visible legend (solid/dashed/edge kinds); filters: edge kind, confidence band, language; filter state persists in URL.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Toggling "inferred edges" off hides exactly the dashed set.
**Depends on:** F0.28.

#### F0.30 — Click-to-highlight neighborhood `P0 · M`
**Story:** Click any node → its direct callers/callees stay lit, everything else dims (Phase 0 checklist, Strategy §6).
**Sub-tasks:** 1-hop neighborhood query (client-side from loaded graph); in/out direction distinction (color-coded); Esc / click-away to clear; deep-linkable selected node (F0.36).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Selection works on 1k-node graphs with no perceptible lag.
- [ ] Shared URL restores the same selection.
**Depends on:** F0.25.

#### F0.31 — GitHub deep links `P0 · S`
**Story:** Click a node's "open in GitHub" affordance → exact file + line range on GitHub (Phase 0 checklist).
**Sub-tasks:** `github.com/owner/repo/blob/{sha}/{path}#L{start}-L{end}` builder using edge/symbol provenance; per-node + per-tooltip action.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Deep link lands on the correct lines for 20 sampled symbols across languages.
**Depends on:** F0.27.

#### F0.32 — Hover tooltips `P1 · S`
**Sub-tasks:** deferred tooltip (~300ms) with signature, path, line range, in/out edge counts; escape hatch on touch devices (tap = select, tooltip suppressed).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Tooltip never blocks clicks on adjacent nodes (hit-testing verified).
**Depends on:** F0.27.

#### F0.33 — Command-palette symbol search `P1 · M`
**Sub-tasks:** ⌘K palette; fuzzy search over qualified names + file paths; result → pans/zooms to node and selects it; recent searches.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Finding any symbol by name takes < 3 interactions on a 1k-node graph.
**Depends on:** F0.25.

#### F0.34 — Large-graph performance `P0 · L`
**Story:** Graphs must stay interactive at realistic repo sizes — a laggy diagram kills the "wow."
**Sub-tasks:** node-count adaptive detail (LOD: labels/edges simplify beyond thresholds); cap visible nodes with "zoom to expand" clusters (folder-level first); edge virtualization; measure with CI perf test (pan/zoom frame time on a 2k-node / 5k-edge fixture).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Interactive (no dropped-frame stalls > 100ms) at 2k nodes / 5k edges on a mid laptop.
- [ ] Repos above render-cap degrade gracefully into folder clusters, never blank.
**Depends on:** F0.25. **Notes:** Budget table §6.5; if React Flow hits its ceiling, the custom-renderer escape hatch in Strategy §7 applies — but only after this feature proves the ceiling is real.

#### F0.35 — Mobile-friendly basics `P2 · S`
**Sub-tasks:** pinch-zoom/tap-select from React Flow defaults; bottom-sheet panel instead of side panel; acceptable OG-image-quality rendering on small screens.
**Acceptance criteria:**

**Depends on:** F0.25.

### Epic 0.5 — Sharing & Distribution

#### F0.36 — Permalink URL scheme & share state `P0 · S`
**Story:** `cartograph.dev/{owner}/{repo}` always resolves to the latest indexed default-branch graph; `cartograph.dev/{owner}/{repo}/at/{sha}` pins a commit; UI state (selection, filters, layout) lives in the URL so shares reproduce exactly.
**Sub-tasks:** routing + canonical URL logic; share-button (copy URL) with toast; state serialization in query params.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Open → select node → copy URL → incognito window shows identical view.
- [ ] Pinned-SHA link never silently redirects to latest.
**Depends on:** F0.02.

#### F0.37 — OG social-preview images `P0 · M`
**Story:** Shared links on Twitter/Discord/Slack show a real graph thumbnail + repo stats — critical for the viral loop (Strategy §6 Phase 0).
**Sub-tasks:** server-rendered PNG via satori + resvg (or equivalent); cached per (repo, sha); layout: repo name, stars, language chips, simplified graph silhouette; fallback image for failed renders.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] OG image renders < 1.5s on cache miss; instant on hit.
- [ ] Twitter card validator + Discord link unfurl both show the image correctly.
**Depends on:** F0.36.

**Sub-tasks:** per-repo meta/title tags ("Call graph of owner/repo"); sitemap with pre-indexed popular repos; robots policy; JSON-LD structured data (SoftwareSourceCode).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] `site:` search intent verifiable; sitemap submitted; Lighthouse SEO ≥ 95 on repo pages.
**Depends on:** F0.36.

#### F0.39 — URL-hack redirect entry `P0 · S`
**Story:** Copy GitDiagram's proven growth mechanic: `cartograph.dev/https://github.com/owner/repo` works, and the README teaches the domain-swap trick (Strategy §10).
**Sub-tasks:** URL-in-URL route parsing; redirect to canonical permalink; the landing explains the trick in one line.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Pasting a full GitHub URL after the domain works from a cold browser.
**Depends on:** F0.36.

#### F0.40 — Browser extension `P1 · M`
**Story:** One click from a GitHub repo page to its Cartograph graph (Strategy §6 Phase 0 "one-click browser extension").
**Sub-tasks:** MV3 extension; content-script button on `github.com/{owner}/{repo}`; opens `cartograph.dev/{owner}/{repo}`; no permissions beyond tabs; Chrome Web Store listing; Firefox build from same codebase.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Works on repo root, subfolder, and file pages (maps to repo).
- [ ] Store review passed.
**Depends on:** F0.36.

#### F0.41 — Landing page `P0 · M`
**Story:** GIF-first, zero-jargon hero, "try it in 20s" with 3 pre-indexed demo repos (Strategy §10 item 1).
**Sub-tasks:** hero GIF of the graph + (later) Trace Mode; one-line value prop; "How is this different from GitDiagram?" honesty section (solid vs dashed framing); FAQ; demo links.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Page communicates the value without scrolling past 2 screens; demo links work.
- [ ] Lighthouse performance ≥ 90 mobile.
**Depends on:** F0.37.

### Epic 0.6 — Ask / Chat

#### F0.42 — Context assembler v1 `P0 · L`
**Story:** The component that keeps LLM answers honest and cheap: pull the *relevant subgraph* + code snippets, never the whole repo (Strategy §4 component 6).
**Sub-tasks:** seed selection (matched symbol from question, else embedding hit from F0.43); k-hop subgraph expansion with token-budget-aware truncation; code-snippet extraction (symbol bodies within budget); prompt template with strict "answer only from context" contract + citation markers; token accounting logged per request.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Prompt size bounded: p95 < 8k tokens regardless of repo size.
- [ ] Question about an unindexed topic → assembler returns "insufficient context" rather than padding.
**Depends on:** F0.23.

#### F0.43 — Embedding pipeline (semantic search) `P1 · M`
**Sub-tasks:** chunk = symbol summary (signature + docstring + 1-hop neighbor names); embedding model choice documented; sqlite-vec index inside the snapshot; semantic search endpoint used by assembler when symbol-match fails.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] "find the code that handles refunds" returns the right file in a test repo's top-3.
- [ ] Index build adds < 20% to indexing time.
**Depends on:** F0.23.

#### F0.44 — Chat UI (streaming) `P0 · M`
**Sub-tasks:** chat panel beside the diagram; SSE token streaming; per-repo conversation history (client-held in v1); suggested starter questions; stop button.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] First token < 2s p75 (budget §6.5); streaming never blocks the diagram interactions.
**Depends on:** F0.42.

#### F0.45 — Grounded-answer contract `P0 · M`
**Story:** Every answer cites what it's based on: clickable references to graph nodes or file/line snippets. No citations → "I couldn't find this in the graph."
**Sub-tasks:** citation format in LLM output (structured markers → rendered links); renderer links citations to nodes (selects them, F0.30) or GitHub (F0.31); refusal path when context is insufficient.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Sampled answers over 3 repos: ≥ 90% of factual claims carry a working citation.
- [ ] Adversarial question outside context yields a refusal, not a hallucination.
**Depends on:** F0.42.

#### F0.46 — Prompt-injection & abuse hardening `P0 · M`
**Story:** Repo content is untrusted input. Code/README text must never be able to steer the assistant beyond answering questions about the repo.
**Sub-tasks:** system prompt isolates repo content as quoted data; injection test suite (malicious comments/READMEs in a fixture repo); no side-effect tools in the ask path; output filtering for obvious exfiltration patterns; per-IP question throttling beyond F0.50 defaults.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Injection fixture repo cannot make the assistant ignore instructions or leak the system prompt.
- [ ] Test suite runs in CI against the live prompt template.
**Depends on:** F0.42.

#### F0.47 — LLM cost controls `P0 · M`
**Story:** Popularity must not equal bankruptcy (Strategy §11 risk #3).
**Sub-tasks:** per-IP daily question budget; per-repo response caching keyed (repo, sha, question-hash); cheap-model routing for simple queries (classification heuristic); budget-exceeded → graceful "graph-only" mode (answers from graph data, no LLM); daily spend dashboard + alarm.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Median ask costs < $0.02 (measured, logged).
- [ ] Exceeding budget degrades to graph-only answers, never a hard error.
**Depends on:** F0.44. **Notes:** Cost model §6.6.

### Epic 0.7 — Caching & API Hygiene

#### F0.48 — Commit-SHA cache layer `P0 · M`
**Status:** 🟡 — SQLite repository+SHA reuse tested end-to-end; full cache-layer acceptance remains unverified.
**Story:** Repeat visits to a popular repo are instant and free (Strategy §4 component 8).
**Sub-tasks:** Redis/KV layer keyed `(repo, commit_sha, language_set)`; hit → serve snapshot pointer (no re-index); explicit re-index action (busts cache); stale-branch handling; cache-hit-rate metric.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Second request for same repo+SHA returns in < 300ms p95.
- [ ] New commit on default branch triggers fresh index automatically.
**Depends on:** F0.23.

#### F0.49 — Popular-repo pre-warm `P2 · S`
**Sub-tasks:** curated list + cron pre-index; pre-warm on demand when a repo trends (request spike heuristic).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Top-20 curated repos always cache-warm; hit rate tracked.
**Depends on:** F0.48.

#### F0.50 — Rate limiting `P0 · S`
**Sub-tasks:** IP-based limits per endpoint class (index: expensive, graph: cheap, ask: separate budget via F0.47); 429 + `Retry-After`; abuse-pattern logging; allowlist for the badge/OG endpoints (they get hot).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Load test: abusive client gets limited before infra strain; normal users unaffected.
**Depends on:** F0.04.

#### F0.51 — Health checks & server metrics `P1 · S`
**Sub-tasks:** `/health` (liveness) + `/health/ready` (deps); metrics: indexing duration by stage, parse-error rate, unresolved-ratio (avg), cache hit rate, queue depth, LLM tokens/day; uptime monitoring on both apps.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Dashboard answers "is indexing healthy right now?" in one glance.
**Depends on:** F0.04.

#### F0.52 — Terms, privacy & attribution `P0 · S`
**Sub-tasks:** Terms; Privacy (what's stored: public repo data, derived graphs; no private repos in v1); repo-content attribution policy; takedown contact; MIT license on the core (Strategy §10 item 6).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Pages linked in footer; license file present at launch.
**Depends on:** —.

## 3. Phase 1 — Trace Mode (Weeks 4–7): the screenshot moment

**Phase goal (Strategy §6):** the signature "wow" feature; launch vehicle for Show HN / Product Hunt.

### Epic 1.1 — Trace Engine

#### F1.01 — Entry-point registry `P0 · M`
**Story:** Trace Mode needs starting points: every HTTP route (F0.21), CLI `main`s, message handlers, and top-level exported symbols, presented as a pickable list.
**Sub-tasks:** entry-point detection and ranking (routes first, then mains, then exports by reference count); entry-point picker UI grouped by type; free-text symbol search as an entry.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Fixture repos expose their routes as traceable entries; unknown frameworks degrade to exports-only.
**Depends on:** F0.21.

#### F1.02 — Forward path tracing `P0 · L`
**Story:** Pick an entry → enumerate the real call paths through the graph (this is the product's signature interaction and it only works because the graph is real — Strategy §3).
**Sub-tasks:** path enumeration (bounded k-shortest-simple-paths; default k=5, depth cap configurable); cycle handling (visited-set, cycles rendered as loop-back markers); path ranking (edge confidence-weighted; prefer statically proven); per-path node/edge list API.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] On a golden repo, the top path for a route matches the hand-verified execution order.
- [ ] Cyclic graphs (recursive/mutual recursion) trace without hanging; loops visibly marked.
- [ ] Trace of a 50-node path returns < 1s server-side.
**Depends on:** F1.01. **Notes:** Confidence-weighting means inferred edges route lower — trace stays honest by construction.

#### F1.03 — Reverse impact tracing `P0 · M`
**Story:** "What breaks if I change this?" — select any symbol → all transitive callers light up (Strategy §6 Phase 1).
**Sub-tasks:** transitive-caller traversal (with depth/size caps + "show more"); impact list sidebar (grouped by file, sorted by distance); exportable impact list (copy as markdown); mixed forward+reverse mode (callers above, callees below).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Impact of a hot utility symbol (100+ callers) caps and paginates without freezing UI.
- [ ] Results include confidence breakdown (how much is proven vs inferred).
**Depends on:** F1.02.

#### F1.04 — Trace animation & step-through `P0 · L`
**Story:** The money shot: watch the request path light up node-by-node across the graph (Strategy §6 Phase 1) — designed to be recorded as a GIF.
**Sub-tasks:** staggered node/edge activation along the traced path; play/pause/replay/speed control; step-through mode (next/prev hop with narration sync F1.05); path-list sidebar (each path clickable); dimming non-path elements; animation respects reduced-motion preference.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Smooth on a 500-node graph (animation is transform/opacity-only, no re-layout).
- [ ] GIF-recordable at 30fps without dropped frames (manual QC on demo repos).
**Depends on:** F1.02.

#### F1.05 — LLM trace narration `P0 · M`
**Story:** Plain-English narration of the *actual* traced path: "this request hits `AuthMiddleware`, then `UserController.login`, which calls `UserService.verify`…" (Strategy §6 Phase 1). The LLM narrates verified structure — never invents it.
**Sub-tasks:** narration prompt fed only the traced path + symbol summaries (bounded); streamed alongside animation; sentence-level sync option (current sentence ↔ current node highlight); refusal when path contains unresolved edges ("part of this path is inferred").
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Narration references only symbols present in the path (automated check over fixture set).
- [ ] Narration cost per trace < $0.01 median.
**Depends on:** F1.02.

### Epic 1.2 — Public API & Embeds

#### F1.06 — Public REST API + API keys `P1 · M`
**Story:** Programmatic access: `GET /v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/graph`, `/trace?entry=...`, `/impact?symbol=...` returning the same JSON the UI consumes (Strategy §6 Phase 1).
**Sub-tasks:** key issuance + hashed storage; auth middleware; OpenAPI spec published; response schemas reuse F0.02 contracts; usage logging per key.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] A stranger can go from docs page to a working `curl` in < 5 minutes.
**Depends on:** F0.23.

#### F1.07 — API rate tiers & docs `P1 · S`
**Sub-tasks:** anonymous vs keyed limits; rate-limit headers on every response; docs page with limits, examples, changelog.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Limits enforced and documented; over-limit returns 429 with guidance.
**Depends on:** F1.06.

#### F1.08 — README architecture badge `P0 · M`
**Story:** The star-history.com-style badge: embeds turn every adopting README into free compounding distribution (Strategy §6 Phase 1, §10 item 4).
**Sub-tasks:** SVG badge endpoint (cached, hot-path exempt from rate limits — see F0.50); badge shows repo name + live stats; markdown snippet generator on the repo page; badge click-through to permalink; batched render caching to survive README-embed traffic spikes.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Badge SVG loads < 100ms p95 (it will be embedded in high-traffic READMEs).
- [ ] Traffic-shape test: 100 concurrent badge fetches don't degrade the main API.
**Depends on:** F0.37.

#### F1.09 — Embeddable read-only viewer `P2 · M`
**Sub-tasks:** iframe + `<script>` embed of the viewer (no chat, no edit); allowlisted origin params; lazy-load postMessage sizing.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Embed works in a docs site (mkdocs/docusaurus test page) with no console errors.
**Depends on:** F0.36.

### Epic 1.3 — Launch

#### F1.10 — Demo-repo curation & pre-index `P0 · S`
**Story:** 5–10 recognizable OSS repos (a popular Express app, a Flask app, etc.) pre-indexed, accuracy hand-checked, cache-warm — the launch-day showcase (Strategy §10 item 3).
**Sub-tasks:** repo selection (recognizable + graph-photogenic + framework coverage); manual accuracy review per repo (this is a QA gate, not a formality — fix parser gaps before launch); pre-warm via F0.49; freshness check script.
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Every demo repo: no wrong edges found in 15-minute human review; instant load.
**Depends on:** F0.48.

#### F1.11 — Show HN / Product Hunt launch kit `P0 · S`
**Story:** Same-day coordinated launch (Strategy §10 item 3): assets, copy, feedback channels ready before F1.10 signs off.
**Sub-tasks:** launch GIFs (trace animation featured); post copy for HN/PH/Twitter; comment-response rota; feedback channel (GitHub Discussions + in-app widget); launch-day monitoring dashboard (errors, queue depth, LLM spend).
**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] Dry run: assets posted to staging; monitoring dashboard live; rollback plan for the API documented.
**Depends on:** F1.10, F1.04.

## 4. Phase 2 — Depth (Months 2–4): the original CodeMonk vision

> **Gate C applies (Strategy §11, risk #6):** Phase 2 infra work (F2.01–F2.07) does **not** start until Phase 0/1 metrics hit thresholds — see §7, Gate C. Lighter-weight cards from here; full cards written at phase kickoff.

### Epic 2.1 — Auth & Multi-Repo Workspaces

| ID | Feature | Story & acceptance criteria (summary) | P · Effort | Depends |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F2.01 | **GitHub OAuth & accounts** | Log in with GitHub; minimal scopes (public data only in this phase); session layer on API. **AC:** login/logout/revocation flows tested; no private-repo tokens accepted yet (explicitly rejected with explanation). | P0 (in-phase) · M | Gate C |
| F2.02 | **Workspace model & UI** | Create a workspace; link N repos; workspace-scoped combined views; workspace = the unit for stitching (F2.04). **AC:** workspace with 3 repos renders selectable per-repo or combined graph; membership persists across sessions. | P1 · L | F2.01 |
| F2.03 | **Cross-repo import resolution** | Resolve imports across linked repos (published-package deps pinned by version, git submodules); produce inter-repo edges marked `cross_repo`. **AC:** two linked repos where A imports B's package show A→B edges with correct pinned-version provenance; version-mismatch = inferred edge + warning. | P1 · XL | F2.02 |

### Epic 2.2 — Cross-Service Contract Stitching

| ID | Feature | Story & acceptance criteria (summary) | P · Effort | Depends |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F2.04 | **Kafka contract extraction** | Extract topics + producer + consumer sites from Kafka client usage/config across workspace repos. **AC:** fixture multi-repo workspace yields correct topic→{producers, consumers} map, hand-verified; config-only topics (yml) also detected. | P1 · L | F2.02 |
| F2.05 | **Queue & broker contract extraction** | RabbitMQ, SQS, Redis streams — same contract model as F2.04. **AC:** one fixture per broker; contracts normalize into the same stitched-edge representation. | P2 · M | F2.04 |
| F2.06 | **Stitched-edge visualization** | "Service A emits `PaymentProcessedEvent` → consumed by B, C" as a distinct edge type in the viewer, clearly labeled contract-level (not a call). **AC:** stitched edges visually distinct + filterable; legend updated; clicking shows both producer and consumer code. | P1 · M | F2.04 |

### Epic 2.3 — Graph Store Evolution

| ID | Feature | Story & acceptance criteria (summary) | P · Effort | Depends |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F2.07 | **Neo4j migration (dual-write & cutover)** | Migrate when cross-repo traversal outgrows SQLite snapshots (Strategy §4 component 4). Dual-write → backfill → parity-check → cutover. **AC:** query-parity suite (same answers SQLite vs Neo4j on golden workspaces) passes; rollback plan executable in < 10 min; single-repo mode still served from snapshots (no regression). | P1 · XL | Gate C |

### Epic 2.4 — PR Diagram Bot

| F2.09 | **Structural graph diff** | Diff graph(base SHA) vs graph(head SHA): added/removed/changed symbols and edges, classified (new call path, removed handler, changed route…). **AC:** fixture PR with known structural changes produces the expected diff classes; comment-only PRs produce empty diff (bot stays quiet). | P1 · L | F2.08 |
| F2.10 | **PR comment renderer** | Bot comments: updated diagram image + human-readable structural-change summary; edits its own comment on force-push (never spams). **AC:** force-push updates the existing comment; "no structural change" → no comment; comment includes both base/head permalink links. | P1 · M | F2.09 |

### Epic 2.5 — Language Expansion

## 5. Phase 3 — Ecosystem (Months 4+): IDE, self-host, SaaS

### Epic 3.1 — VS Code Extension

| ID | Feature | Story & acceptance criteria (summary) | P · Effort | Depends |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F3.01 | **Extension core & repo matching** | Detect current workspace's repo; fetch its graph; auth token entry (keyed API). **AC:** opens a graph view for the active repo; unmatched repos → clear guidance. | P2 · M | — |
| F3.02 | **Hover call-graph popover** | Hover a function → mini callers/callees popover inline (Strategy §6 Phase 3). **AC:** popover < 300ms on cached graphs; click-through opens the full viewer. | P2 · M | F3.01 |
| F3.03 | **In-editor trace panel** | Run Trace Mode inside the IDE; results link to files/lines. **AC:** a traced route opens each hop at the right line via `revealDefinition`. | P3 · L | F3.02 |

### Epic 3.2 — JetBrains Plugin

| ID | Feature | Story & acceptance criteria (summary) | P · Effort | Depends |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F3.04 | **JetBrains plugin core** | Parity with F3.01 + F3.02 (IntelliJ platform, Kotlin plugin). **AC:** parity checklist passes on IntelliJ IDEA. | P3 · L | — |
| F3.05 | **JetBrains trace panel** | Parity with F3.03. **AC:** trace from editor → hop navigation works. | P3 · M | F3.04 |

### Epic 3.3 — Self-Host Bundle

| ID | Feature | Story & acceptance criteria (summary) | P · Effort | Depends |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F3.06 | **Docker Compose self-host bundle** | One command up: api + worker + web + db + redis; works against GitHub Enterprise via base-URL config (Strategy §6 Phase 3, enterprise-friendly). **AC:** fresh machine → `docker compose up` → index a repo end-to-end; GHE smoke test documented. | P2 · L | — |
| F3.07 | **Self-host docs, upgrades & license** | Upgrade path, health checks, backup/restore for snapshots, license clarity (core MIT, enterprise add-ons clearly scoped). **AC:** documented upgrade between two tagged versions succeeds without data loss. | P2 · M | F3.06 |

### Epic 3.4 — Hosted SaaS Tier

| ID | Feature | Story & acceptance criteria (summary) | P · Effort | Depends |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F3.08 | **Stripe billing & plans** | Free / Pro / Team; usage metering (indexing minutes, ask queries, repo size ceiling); paywalls without breaking the free core (Strategy §6 Phase 3: core stays free). **AC:** plan changes prorate; free tier limits unchanged from public product; metering matches Stripe records in reconciliation test. | P2 · L | F2.01 |
| F3.09 | **Private-repo indexing** | Encrypted clone handling, minimal scoped tokens, auto-delete guarantees (retention config), private-repo isolation (never cached publicly, never in OG/badge flows). **AC:** private repo graphs never appear in shared caches/OG images (test suite proves isolation); token revocation stops all access. | P2 · L | F2.01, F3.08 |

## 6. Cross-Cutting Specs

### 6.1 Data model v1 (column-level)

```sql
-- One SQLite snapshot per (repo_id, sha); blobs on object storage
Repo        (id PK, owner, name, default_branch, last_indexed_sha,
             size_bucket, language_set JSON, indexed_at)

File        (id PK, repo_id FK→Repo, path, language, loc, blob_sha)
            UNIQUE(repo_id, path)

Symbol      (id PK, file_id FK→File,
             kind CHECK IN ('function','method','class','module','route','entrypoint'),
             name, qualified_name, signature,
             start_line, end_line, is_exported BOOL)
            UNIQUE(repo_id, qualified_name)  -- via join; index (repo_id, qualified_name)

Edge        (id PK, from_symbol FK→Symbol, to_symbol FK→Symbol,
             kind CHECK IN ('calls','imports','extends','implements',
                            'handles_route','instantiates','publishes','consumes','cross_repo'),
             confidence REAL,        -- rules in §6.3
             resolution CHECK IN ('static','inferred','heuristic'),
             meta JSON)              -- call sites: [{file, line}]

EmbeddingChunk (id PK, symbol_id FK→Symbol, summary_text, vector BLOB)

IndexJob    (id PK, repo_id, sha, status, stage, attempts, error,
             queued_at, started_at, finished_at)
```

- **`publishes`/`consumes`/`cross_repo`** edge kinds are reserved now (Phase 2: F2.03, F2.04) so v1 schemas don't migrate.
- **Stable IDs:** `sha1(owner/repo/sha/rel_path/qualified_name)` — see F0.22. Never use row autoincrement IDs in URLs or APIs.
- **Counts to expose per repo:** files, symbols, edges by kind, % statically resolved (the honesty stat).

### 6.2 API surface v1

| Method & path | Purpose | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /api/index` | Kick off indexing `{github_url}` | Returns job id, or 302 to cached permalink |
| `GET /api/jobs/{id}` | Job status/stage (poll or SSE) | Powers F0.13 |
| `GET /api/graph?owner&repo[&sha]` | Graph snapshot JSON (nodes/edges/stats) | Cached by F0.48 |
| `GET /api/graph/neighbors?symbol_id&hops=1` | Neighborhood for highlight (F0.30) | Client-side fallback if graph already loaded |
| `POST /api/ask` | Grounded Q&A | SSE stream; budget-gated (F0.47) |
| `GET /api/og/{owner}/{repo}.png` | OG preview image | Cached; hot-path |
| `GET /api/badge/{owner}/{repo}.svg` | README badge | Cached; hot-path; rate-limit exempt (F0.50) |
| `GET /v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/graph` | Public API graph | Keys (F1.06); Phase 1 |
| `GET /v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/trace` | Public API trace | `?entry=route:POST /login` etc. |
| `GET /v1/repos/{owner}/{repo}/impact` | Public API impact | `?symbol=...` |
| `GET /health`, `GET /health/ready` | Liveness / readiness | F0.51 |

### 6.3 Confidence model (the honesty spec)

| Resolution situation | Confidence | Rendered |
|---|---|---|
| Direct call, same file, statically typed/obvious receiver | 1.00 | solid |
| Cross-file via resolved import (exact module path) | 0.95 | solid |
| Resolved through re-export barrel (≤ 3 hops) | 0.85 | solid |
| Dynamic `import()` / `importlib` with literal string | 0.60 | dashed |
| Duck-typed / `getattr` / `any`-typed receiver | 0.40 | dashed |
| Framework magic (decorator-registered handler, DI container) | 0.40–0.60 | dashed |
| Unresolved call site | — (edge dropped) | counted in repo's unresolved-ratio stat |

- Single source of truth: `DASHED_BELOW = 0.50` — parser, store, and UI all import it (F0.20).
- Repo stats panel shows "% of call sites statically resolved" — surfaced, never hidden. This stat is also a parser-quality dashboard metric (F0.24, F0.51).
- Rule changes require a golden-suite (F0.24) re-run in the PR.

### 6.4 Testing strategy

1. **Golden repos (the accuracy gate, F0.24):** 6–10 curated repos, hand-verified expected graphs; CI computes precision/recall. Start: precision ≥ 0.95, recall ≥ 0.90 on `calls` edges. Thresholds are phase-gate inputs, tune after first real-world data.
2. **Fixture unit tests:** per-extractor construct fixtures (F0.16/F0.17) — 100% match expected.
3. **Fuzz/property:** parser never crashes on arbitrary bytes; per-file errors are contained.
4. **E2E (Playwright):** paste URL → diagram → select → deep-link → ask → trace (the full user journey), plus every F0.14 error state.
5. **Perf tests in CI:** layout budget (F0.26), render budget (F0.34), cache latency (F0.48).
6. **Injection suite:** prompt-injection fixtures run against the live prompt template (F0.46).
7. **Manual QA ritual per release:** 15-minute human accuracy review of the demo repos (F1.10) — the LLM-free check that keeps marketing claims honest.

### 6.5 Performance budgets (backing Strategy §12's "< 30 seconds")

| Stage | Budget (p75, repo ≤ 2k files) |
|---|---|
| Fetch (tree API / clone) | ≤ 8s |
| Parse (all languages) | ≤ 10s |
| Graph build + store | ≤ 3s |
| Layout | ≤ 3s |
| First graph paint | ≤ 3s |
| **Total time-to-first-diagram** | **< 30s** (target < 15s) |
| Cached graph load (p95) | < 300ms |
| Ask first token (p75) | < 2s |
| Render interactivity | no stall > 100ms at 2k nodes / 5k edges |

### 6.6 Cost model (v1 assumptions, revisit monthly)

- LLM: Sonnet-class; ask prompt bounded ≤ 8k tokens (F0.42) → median ask < $0.02; trace narration < $0.01; per-IP daily budget with graph-only degradation (F0.47); response caching keyed (repo, sha, question-hash).
- Infra: Vercel (web) + one small Fly.io VM (api + workers) + Redis + blob storage for snapshots ≈ low tens of $/month pre-scale.
- GitHub API: token-backed budget; tree-API-first strategy keeps clone load low; ETags cut redundant calls.
- Alarm thresholds: daily LLM spend ×2 of 7-day median; queue depth > 50; indexing p95 > 2× budget.

### 6.7 Analytics event taxonomy (initial)

`repo_indexed`, `index_failed`, `diagram_viewed`, `node_selected`, `github_link_opened`, `filter_toggled`, `share_copied`, `ask_sent`, `ask_answered`, `trace_started`, `trace_completed`, `badge_viewed`, `badge_snippet_copied`, `extension_opened`, `urlhack_landing`.
North-star funnel for Gate B/C: `diagram_viewed → trace_started` (target ≥ 40%, Strategy §12) and `badge_snippet_copied` (distribution proxy).

### 6.8 Security & abuse posture

- **Untrusted code = untrusted input:** parsing in workers with per-file timeouts; no code execution from parsed content; clone path traversal/zip-bomb guards.
- **SSRF:** only `github.com` (later: configured GHE host) origins allowed for fetch/clone; no following arbitrary URLs from repo content.
- **Prompt injection:** repo content is quoted data in prompts; no side-effect tools in the ask path; injection suite in CI (F0.46).
- **No private repos in v1 at all** — no token-entry UI exists to abuse; private indexing arrives only with F3.09's isolation guarantees.
- **Rate limits** (F0.50) with CAPTCHA escalation on sustained abuse; badge/OG hot paths exempt but cached aggressively.

### 6.9 Definition of Done (applies to every feature card)

1. Code reviewed via PR; CI green (lint, types, tests).
2. All card acceptance criteria verified — a criterion that can't be verified gets rewritten until it can.
3. User-visible changes: analytics event emitted + error states handled.
4. Golden-suite run if parser/resolution/confidence logic changed.
5. Docs touched when relevant (README, ARCHITECTURE, API docs).
6. Interactive features meet the accessibility baseline (§6.10).
7. Master tracker (§1) + card status updated; changelog (§9) line appended.

### 6.10 Accessibility baseline (applies to every interactive feature)

1. **Keyboard:** the canvas (pan/zoom/select via React Flow defaults), ⌘K palette, chat panel, and all filters are fully operable without a mouse; visible focus states everywhere.
2. **Reduced motion:** Trace Mode animation (F1.04), skeletons, and transitions respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
3. **Contrast & labels:** node/edge colors meet WCAG AA contrast against the canvas background; icon-only controls carry `aria-label`s; the legend (F0.29) is readable as text.
4. **Screen-reader landmarks:** diagram region, chat region, and status messages (indexing progress, errors) are announced.

## 7. Milestone Gates

| Gate | When | Exit criteria (measurable) |
|---|---|---|
| **A — MVP done** | end of Phase 0 | Stranger: paste URL → correct interactive diagram < 30s; golden suite green at thresholds; all 14 F0.14 error states reachable; 20 friendly-user smoke sessions with zero P0 bugs open; F0.52 live |
| **B — Trace launch** | end of Phase 1 | Trace Mode live on all demo repos (F1.10 QC passed); badge shipped and embedded in ≥ 3 friendly repos; Show HN submitted; baseline metrics captured for the funnel in §6.7 |
| **C — Depth authorization** (the anti-scope-creep gate, Strategy §11) | before any Phase 2 infra (F2.01–F2.07) | ≥ 1,000 GitHub stars **and** ≥ 40% of diagram viewers use Trace Mode **and** ≥ 50 badge embeds. **Not met →** next 2 weeks go to growth/accuracy work, not infra. Re-check weekly. |
| **D — Monetization authorization** | before F3.08–F3.11 | ≥ 200 private-repo waitlist signups or ≥ 3 inbound enterprise conversations; self-host bundle (F3.06) shipped as the enterprise beachhead |

## 8. Risk Register (expanded)

| # | Risk | Trigger signal (what we watch) | Mitigation | Contingency if it fires |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Large monorepos blow up compute | Queue depth > 50; indexing p95 > 2× budget (F0.51 alarms) | Hard caps (F0.10), async jobs (F0.12), friendly queue UI (F0.13) | Degrade to file-level graph (skip symbol resolution) for oversized repos — still useful, still honest |
| 2 | Dynamic-language accuracy disappoints | Unresolved-ratio > 30% on popular repos (per-repo stat, F0.20/F0.51) | Confidence scoring + dashed edges + honesty framing (§6.3) | Pull LSP-based resolution forward from Strategy §7's v2 column; publish an accuracy dashboard; lean into the honesty narrative |
| 3 | LLM costs scale with popularity | Daily spend ×2 of 7-day median (F0.47 alarm) | Bounded context (F0.42), response cache, per-IP budgets (F0.47) | Graph-only answer mode default-on for unauthenticated traffic |
| 4 | GitDiagram-style clones copy the URL hack | Competitive launches (manual watch) | Moat = parsing accuracy + Trace Mode, not the trick (Strategy §11) | Ship the "solid vs dashed" accuracy comparison page; double down on golden-suite-derived accuracy claims |
| 5 | Scope creep back toward "CodeMonk-heavy" | Phase 2 work started while Gate C unmet | Gate C enforced in weekly review (§7) | Hard stop: reassign to growth backlog; phase gate is a rule, not a suggestion |
| 6 | tree-sitter misses framework magic (decorators, DI, route registries) | Golden-suite misses concentrated in framework files (F0.24 triage) | Per-framework extractors (F0.21), heuristic edges marked inferred | Publish a "supported frameworks" table; unsupported = routes come from config files only, clearly labeled |
| 7 | Trace Mode underused (the wow doesn't wow) | `trace_started / diagram_viewed` < 20% two weeks post-launch (§6.7 funnel) | Entry-point picker defaults, suggested traces (F1.01) | Auto-trace the most-trafficked route by default on load; onboarding tooltip; revisit entry-point ranking |
| 8 | Badge/OG hot-path traffic degrades the API | Badge p95 latency rising (F0.51) | Rate-limit exemption + aggressive caching (F0.48/F0.50/F1.08) | Serve badge/OG from edge/static layer; pre-render top-100 |
| 9 | React Flow ceiling hit before F0.34 lands | Frame-time CI test regressing (F0.34) | LOD + clustering + caps (F0.34) | Custom WebGL renderer (Strategy §7's stated escape hatch) — only with Gate C metrics proving demand for huge graphs |
| 10 | Solo/small-team burnout on a 90-feature plan | Changelog velocity stalls; 🚫 statuses pile up | Effort-sized cards, strict phase gates, P0-first ordering (§1) | Cut P2s without ceremony (that's what the column is for); shrink Phase 0 scope to the true viral core: F0.07–F0.31, F0.36–F0.41, F0.48, F0.50 |

## 9. Changelog

Tracking log — append one line per status change (see §0.4).

2026-10-03 · F0.08 remains 🟡 · resilience and pinned-fetch implementation passes combined 141-test suite; token-backed live acceptance and large-repo clone routing still open. Do not start the next feature until this feature's remaining scope is resolved.
